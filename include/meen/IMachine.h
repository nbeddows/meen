			The first method will be called once with a `char` array of the size specified by the `maxLoadStateLen`
			configuration option (or the default value of 512 if not specified). When the computed json asset
			size (file:// or json:// for example) is larger than the `jsonLen` parameter an errc::invalid_argument
			shall be returned and the user must set the `maxLoadStateLen` configuration option with a larger
			value before invoking this method again. Upon successfully copying out the load state buffer to the
			supplied json array, the `jsonLen` parameter must be set to the actual size of the load state buffer.

			Upon successfully loading the new machine state specified by the json set in the first method the
			second method will be called to indicate that the json load is complete.

			The json layout of an example load state is specifed in the json snippet below:<br>

							{"bytes":"file://rom1.bin","offset":256,"size":128}
						]
					}

			}

			@endcode

			The memory:rom:block array can be omitted if loading from a single file:<br>

			@code{.json}

			{
				"memory": {
					"rom":{
						// Load from local disk all bytes from the file rom0.bin starting at the memory address 0x0000.
						{"bytes":"file://rom0.bin"}
					}

			| base64://zlib://	  | Decompress the remaining bytes, base64 decode them and load them into memory                    |

			The size and offset parameters of memory:rom:[block] are optional and will default to 0 for the offset and the length of the remaining bytes in the bytes parameter for size.
			NOTE: the size parameter is mandatory for "zlib://" and MUST be the length of the uncompressed bytes.

			@param	onLoad						The method to call to get the json machine state to load when the ISR::Load

										and non-blocking as superfluous delays here can have an impact on overall performace.
