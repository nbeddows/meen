	/** Machine interface

		An abstract representation of a basic machine with a cpu, clock and
		custom memory and IO. Unless specifically stated in this API, there is no
		guarantee in regards to thread safety. All methods should be called
		from the same thread.

		Basic Principles of Operation (error checking has been ommitted for simplicity):

		@code{.cpp}

		// Create a synchronous i8080 machine running as fast as possible 
		auto machine = Make8080Machine();

		// Create a custom memory controller (See tests for examples)
		auto customMemoryController = std::make_unique<CustomMemoryController>();

		// Load controller with a program via a custom controller method
		customMemoryController->LoadProgram("myProgram.com");

		// Create a custom IO Controller (See tests for examples)
		auto customIOController = std::make_unique<CustomIOController>();

		// Set the memory and IO controllers with the machine
		machine->SetIOController(customIOController);
		machine->SetMemoryController(customMemoryController);

		// Can be called from a different thread if the runAsync/loadAsync options are specifed
		machine_->OnLoad([]
		{
			// Return the json state to load, could be read from disk for example
			return "json state as passed to OnSave";
		});

		// Can be called from a different thread if the runAsync/saveAsync options are specifed
		machine->OnSave([](const char* json)
		{
			// Handle the machines current state, for example, writing it to disk
			std::cout << json << std::endl;
		});		
		
		// Set the ram/rom sizes (0x2000 and 0x4000) and offsets (0x0000, 0x2000) for this custom memory controller
		// These values are used for load and save requests
		machine_->SetOptions(R"({"romOffset":0,"romSize":8192,"ramOffset":8192,"ramSize":16384})");

		// Set the clock resolution - not setting this will run the
		// machine as fast as possible (default)
		machine->SetOptions(R"({"clockResolution":20000000})"); // 20 milliseconds (50Hz)

		// Run the machine sychronously, it won't return until the custom IO
		// controller ServiceInterrupts override generates an ISR::Quit interrupt
		auto runTime = machine->Run();

		// Run the machine asychronously - this can be done by setting the following json config
		// option either in the MakeMachine factory method or via IMachine::SetOptions
		machine->SetOptions(R"({"runAsync":true})");
		machine->Run();

		// ...
		// Do additional work here while the machine is running
		// ...

		// Will not return until the custom IO
		// controller ServiceInterrupts override generates an ISR::Quit interrupt
		runTime = machine->WaitForCompletion();
